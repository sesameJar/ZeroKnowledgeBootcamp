### Q1. 
- 1 Yes
- 2 No

### Q3. 
- 1 O(n) : The complexity of the operation is linear to the size of input
- 2 O(1): The complexity of the operation isn't affected by the size of input
- 3 O(log n ): The complexity of the operation is logaritmic to the size of input

##### For a proof size, we prefer O(1) so that the verification of the proof isn't affected by the size of the proof
